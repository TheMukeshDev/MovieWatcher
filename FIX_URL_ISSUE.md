# 🚨 CRITICAL FIX - WRONG URL!

## ❌ YOU ARE USING THE WRONG URL!

Look at your browser address bar in the screenshot:
```
10.168.144.228:5500/index.html
```

This is **WRONG**! This is a Live Server and Socket.IO CANNOT connect!

## ✅ CORRECT URL TO USE:

```
http://localhost:3000
```

## 📋 STEP-BY-STEP FIX:

### For the FIRST user (mukesh - already working):
1. ✅ You're already connected correctly
2. ✅ You created room: `room-ciemid65s`
3. ✅ You can chat and everything works

### For the SECOND user (khushi - NOT working):
1. ❌ Close the tab with `10.168.144.228:5500`
2. ✅ Open a NEW tab
3. ✅ Type: `http://localhost:3000`
4. ✅ Enter username: `khushi`
5. ✅ Enter Room ID: `room-ciemid65s`
6. ✅ Click "Join/Create Room"

## 🧪 HOW TO TEST IF YOU'RE ON THE CORRECT URL:

1. Press **F12** to open browser console
2. Look for: `✅ Connected to server:`
   - If you see this = CORRECT URL ✅
   - If you see `Connection error` = WRONG URL ❌

## 🔄 TO OPEN MULTIPLE USERS:

### Method 1: Multiple Browser Tabs (Same Browser)
1. Tab 1: `http://localhost:3000` → Login as "mukesh"
2. Tab 2: `http://localhost:3000` → Login as "khushi" with same Room ID

### Method 2: Different Browsers
1. Chrome: `http://localhost:3000` → Login as "mukesh"
2. Edge: `http://localhost:3000` → Login as "khushi" with same Room ID

### Method 3: Incognito Mode
1. Normal window: `http://localhost:3000` → "mukesh"
2. Incognito window (Ctrl+Shift+N): `http://localhost:3000` → "khushi"

## 📺 WHAT YOU SHOULD SEE WHEN IT WORKS:

Server logs will show:
```
User connected: [socket-id-1]
mukesh joined room room-ciemid65s
User connected: [socket-id-2]  ← Second user connects!
khushi joined room room-ciemid65s ← Both in same room!
```

## 🎯 THE SOLUTION:

**STOP using Live Server (port 5500)!**
**ONLY use http://localhost:3000**
