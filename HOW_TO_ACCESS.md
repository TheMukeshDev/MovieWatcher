# ⚠️ IMPORTANT - HOW TO ACCESS THE APP

## ❌ Wrong Way (Current Issue)
You are currently accessing:
- http://10.168.144.228:5500/index.html (Live Server)
- This will NOT work because Socket.IO cannot connect!

## ✅ Correct Way

1. Make sure the Node.js server is running:
   ```powershell
   npm start
   ```

2. You should see:
   ```
   🎬 Watch Party server running on http://localhost:3000
   ```

3. Open your browser and go to:
   **http://localhost:3000**

   NOT the Live Server URL!

## 🐛 Debugging

Open browser console (F12) to see connection logs:
- ✅ "Connected to server" = Working correctly
- ❌ "Connection error" = Wrong URL or server not running

## 🔧 Quick Fix

**Close the current tab and open a new one at: http://localhost:3000**
